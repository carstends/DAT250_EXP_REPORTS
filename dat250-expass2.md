# Software Technology Experiment Assignment 2

In this assignement I have succesfully done some initial experimenting with JPA, set up a database using Apache Derby and studied object-relational mapping. 

### Assignment 1

Derby 10.14.2.0 was installed and tested by completing the tutorial given in the assignement:

## Derby setup

## Eclipselink:

## JUNIT

Note: I had an unresolved issue were if I used Junit 5, an error message conatining: <i> No test found using Junit 5 </i> , changing to Junit 4 is a temporary solution. 

### Assignment 2
Attempt to implement domain model is attatched in assignment 2 folder


## Other unresolved issues

Trying to inspect the database and table created with JPA and Eclipselink, ij was and still is unable to recognize todo as a table, even though ij sees it with the 'show' command. I tried to create a new schema and table through ij in the same database, and then it worked. But the table created with JPA is still inaccessible.

issue with ij and JPA:

I also had problems connecting Eclipse and github. Eclipse freezes for a second when I 'add to index', and then nothing is added. Restart won't work. Implementations are therefore uploaded directly as file system.
