# Software Technology Experiment - Assignment 3

In this assignement I have got familiar with MongoDB following the official tutorial - reading some documentation, performing the necassary installation and a 
set-up of a small db with crud-operations tested on it. 

-- Technical problems
: None

### Getting started

The 'getting started' tutorial from mongodb step 0-4 went smooth, and provided a clear introduction



### Experiment 1

Installation and verification

Following with screenshots from the official mongodb CRUD operations tutorial:

### Experiment 2

I have completed an introductory course to how to Map-reduce operation works, and 
how it can be useful. Some of the usefulness comes fromt that it can aggragate big complex data-sets into smaller 
ones - making it a useful tool in big data.

#### Own implementation

It's probably useful to know the average price spent sometimes to get more insight, and not just the sum
