In this assignment I have made some initial experimentation with the REST AP and the Spark/Java Framework for implementing microservices. 

The first task in this experiment went smoothly without problems. Running on localhost and using GET and PUT request in Postman worked.

The 2. task went OK. I implemented the the CRUD operations with REST API. The only I had was dependancies with spark (SLF4J: Failed to load class). I managed to solve it in an OK manner - but eclipse might be a little unstable because sometimes it seems to work - sometimes not. 

I am still working with the problem to see if I can get something more complete and stable.
